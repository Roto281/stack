			<h2 class="section-header"> A little about me </h2>
			<p>I am currently working on a Computer Science degree and a minor in Business. 
			This is my third year at Northwest and will be graduating the Spring of 2020 (fingers crossed!).

		<section id="past-section">
			<h2 class="section-header"> More history </h2>
			<p>I moved to Maryville about 10 years ago when my mother was hired as a math professor at Northwest. 
			Growing up here gave me a lot of experience with preparing for college and learning how to be a successful student.

			<h2 class="section-header"> Current Ambitions </h2>
			<p>I am currently the owner of a landscaping, lawn-care, tree service company. 
			I started it four years ago and has grown to an impressive size in such a short period, keeping me very busy for a majority of the year.
			Through my growing experience in business management and excavation, I plan to start a civil engineering/excavating firm once I receive my diploma and sell my current business. </p>
